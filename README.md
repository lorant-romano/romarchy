# Romarchy

Turn a fresh Arch installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern development system based on Hyprland by running a single command.

Romarchy is a personal fork of [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy), reimagined with my favorite apps and tweaks. Like Omarchy, there's no need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or keep up with the latest command-line trends.  

Romarchy is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best — but now with my own flavor: apps I actually use daily, minimal bloat, and a setup ready for serious software development work.

## Why Romarchy?

Because life is too short to fight dotfiles for days before you can open your editor and start shipping. Romarchy aims to be:

- **Clean** — minimal, fast, and elegant Hyprland-based setup.
- **Ready** — comes pre-configured with my chosen apps and tools for software development.
- **Flexible** — easy to adapt and extend if you're picky (you probably are).
